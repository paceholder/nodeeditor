QtNodes
#######

Introduction
============

**QtNodes** is conceived as a general-purpose Qt-based library aimed at
developing Node Editors for various applications. The library could be used for
simple graph visualization and editing or extended further for using the
`Dataflow paradigm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming>`_ .

The library is written using the Model-View approach. The whole graph structure
is defined by a class derived from ``AbstractGraphModel``.  It is possible to
create or add Nodes and Connections. The underlying data structures could be of
any arbitrary type or representation.

An instance of ``AbstractGraphModel`` could or could not be attached to
specialized ``QGraphicsScene`` and ``QGraphicsView`` objects. I.e. the so-called
"headless" `modus operandi` is possible.

Data Flow Paradigm
==================

The extended model class ``DataFlowGraphModel`` allows to register "processing
algorithms" represented by nodes and is equipped with a set of Qt's signals and
slots for propagating the data though the nodes.

The node's algorithm is triggered upon arriving of any new input data. The
computed result is propagated to the output connections. Each new connection
fetches available data and propagates is further. Each change in the source node
is immediately propagated through all the connections updating the whole graph.

Building
========

Linux
-----

::

  git clone git@github.com:paceholder/nodeeditor.git
  cd nodeeditor
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make -j && make install


Qt Creator
----------

1. Open `CMakeLists.txt` as project.
2. If you don't have the `Catch2` library installed, go to `Build Settings`, disable the checkbox `BUILD_TESTING`.
3. `Build -> Run CMake`
4. `Build -> Build All`
5. Click the button `Run`


With Cmake using `vcpkg`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Install `vcpkg`
2. Add the following flag in configuration step of `CMake`

::

   -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg_dir>/scripts/buildsystems/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake


Version 3 Highlights
====================

#. Headless mode.
   You can create, populate, modify the derivative of AbstractGraphModel
   without adding it to the actual Flow Scene.
   The library is now designed to be general-purpose graph
   visualization and modification tool, without specialization on only
   data propagation.
#. Build data propagation on top of the graph code.
   The library coudl be used for a pure grph visualization purposes as well as
   for originally implemented data propagation.


Help Needed
===========

#. Python wrappring using PySide.
#. QML frontend.
#. Wirting a ClangFormat config.

Any suggestions are welcome!


Contribution
============

#. Be polite, respectful and collaborative.
#. For submitting a bug:

    #. Describe your environment (Qt version, compiler, OS etc)
    #. Describe steps to reproduce the issue

#. For submitting a pull request:

   #. Create a proposal task first. We can come up with a better design together.
   #. Create a pull-request. If applicable create a simple example to your
         iescribe your problem in details, provide use cases,

#. For submitting a development request:

   #. Describe your issue in details
   #. Provide some use cases.

#. I maintain this probject in my free time, when I am not busy with my work or
   my family. **If I do not react or do not answer for too long, please ping
   me**.

CANdevStudio
------------

`CANdevStudio <https://github.com/GENIVI/CANdevStudio>`_ is a cost-effective,
cross-platform replacement for CAN simulation software. CANdevStudio enables to
simulate CAN signals such as ignition status, doors status or reverse gear by
every automotive developer. Thanks to modularity it is easy to implement new,
custom features.

It features easy bindings to C/C++, package management, and a cool interface.


Spkgen particle editor
----------------------

`Spkgen <https://github.com/fredakilla/spkgen>`_ is an editor for the SPARK
particles engine that uses a node-based interface to create particles effects for
games
