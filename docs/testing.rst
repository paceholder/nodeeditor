Key Features
------------

**Segfault Resolution**: Fixed critical infinite recursion in signal emission
that was causing stack overflow crashes during graphics system updates.

**API Modernization**: Updated from v2.x to v3.x Model-View architecture
with proper AbstractGraphModel implementation following QtNodes best practices.

**Clean Dependencies**: Removed internal header dependencies, using only
public APIs for better stability and maintainability.

**Signal Emission Testing**: Comprehensive verification of all AbstractGraphModel 
signals using QSignalSpy, ensuring proper signal emission for all operations 
including node creation/deletion, connection creation/deletion, and node updates.

**Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests all major functionality including node
management, connections, serialization, undo system, and graphics integration.

**Port Bounds Validation**: Added proper validation in ``connectionPossible()``
to ensure port indices are within valid ranges.

Building Tests
--------------

Tests are built automatically when ``BUILD_TESTING`` is enabled (default).

**Prerequisites:**
  - Catch2 testing framework
  - Qt6 (or Qt5 with appropriate configuration)
  - CMake 3.8+

**Configuration:**

.. code-block:: bash

    # Enable testing (default)
    cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
    
    # Disable testing
    cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF

**Build:**

.. code-block:: bash

    # Build library and tests
    make
    
    # Build only tests
    make test_nodes

Test Implementation Details
---------------------------

**TestGraphModel**: A complete implementation of ``AbstractGraphModel`` that provides:
  - Full node and connection management
  - Proper signal emission patterns
  - Serialization support
  - Integration with graphics systems

**UITestHelper**: A namespace providing utility functions for UI interaction testing:
  - ``simulateMousePress/Move/Release()`` - Low-level mouse event simulation
  - ``simulateMouseDrag()`` - High-level drag operation simulation
  - ``waitForUI(ms = 10)`` - Optimized UI event processing with 10ms default timing
  - Proper Qt event system integration for realistic UI testing

**Signal Safety**: The test model implements signal emission patterns that prevent
infinite recursion between the model and graphics system, following the approach
used in ``examples/simple_graph_model``.

**Mock Objects**: Comprehensive stub implementations for testing without external
dependencies, including ``StubNodeDataModel`` for node delegate testing.

Troubleshooting
---------------

**Common Issues:**

* **Catch2 not found**: Install Catch2 or disable testing with ``-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF``
* **Qt version conflicts**: Ensure consistent Qt5/Qt6 usage throughout build
* **Missing test binary**: Check that ``BUILD_TESTING`` is enabled in CMake configuration

**Performance Notes:**
  - Tests include Qt application setup overhead
  - Graphics tests may show Qt warnings about runtime directories (these are harmless)
  - UI tests use optimized 10ms timing for consistent performance
  - Full test suite typically completes in under 10 seconds
